## Hi.
I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at UCLA in 2017.
After that, I stayed at UCLA to work on a Computer Science Masters Degree.
Right now, I'm finishing my degree and also
working with the Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy ([VCLA](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/)).
I'm being advised by Professor Song-Chun Zhu and working with Siyuan Qi.
I'm interested in AI and, in particular, modelling human intelligence and
thought.
